# BH-PCMLAI_Modules11
This repo contains the practical application assignment for Mod11

OVERVIEW
In this application, you will explore a dataset from kaggle. The original dataset contained information on 3 million used cars. The provided dataset contains information on 426K cars to ensure speed of processing. Your goal is to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive. As a result of your analysis, you should provide clear recommendations to your client -- a used car dealership -- as to what consumers value in a used car.

All steps for data preparation:
1. Load data
2. Shape, size, data info, columns
3. Duplicated values
4. Drop unwanted rows and columns
5. Missing values

Findings
1. 'Year' seem to be highest factor which is correlated to the 'price'
2. Type of 'anufacturer' is impacting the 'price'
3. Less miles on the car seem to be positively correlated to the 'price'¶
4. Type of 'fuel' is impacting the 'price'
5. No. of 'cylinders' cars seem to be also impacting the 'price'
